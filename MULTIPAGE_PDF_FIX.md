# Multi-Page PDF Processing Fix

## Problem
The system was only processing the **first page** of multi-page PDFs, resulting in:
- Only fields from page 1 being detected during upload
- Downloaded PDFs only containing page 1
- Lost data from pages 2, 3, etc.

## Root Cause
Multiple functions were explicitly accessing only `page[0]` or `pdf_document[0]`, processing only the first page:
- `documents/views.py`: `pdf_to_image()` only converted first page
- `enhanced_document_processor.py`: OCR detection only processed first page  
- `simple_enhanced_processor.py`: Only converted first page to image
- `create_filled_pdf()`: Only copied first page to output

## Solution
Updated all PDF processing functions to handle **all pages**:

### 1. Updated `documents/views.py`
- **`pdf_to_image()` → `pdf_to_images()`**: Now converts all pages to images
- **`_process_document_fallback()`**: Processes each page separately and combines results
- **`find_blank_spaces()`**: Added `page_num` parameter to track which page fields belong to
- **`create_virtual_fields_from_text()`**: Added `page_num` parameter
- **`create_filled_pdf()`**: Now loops through all pages and includes all pages in output PDF
- **`upload_document()`**: Field storage now includes `page` number

### 2. Updated `enhanced_document_processor.py`
- **`_detect_fields_from_ocr()`**: Processes all PDF pages in a loop
- **`_detect_form_fields_advanced()`**: Added `page_num` parameter
- **`_detect_rectangular_fields()`**: Added `page_num` parameter and stores page in field
- **`_detect_text_based_fields()`**: Added `page_num` parameter and stores page in field
- **`_detect_line_based_fields()`**: Added `page_num` parameter and stores page in field
- **`convert_form_fields_to_dict()`**: Now includes `page` field in output

### 3. Updated `simple_enhanced_processor.py`
- **`_process_pdf_simple()`**: Processes all pages with text extraction
- **`_pdf_to_image()` → `_pdf_to_images()`**: Converts all pages
- **`_detect_fields_simple()`**: Added `page_num` parameter and stores page in field
- **`convert_form_fields_to_dict()`**: Now includes `page` field in output

## Key Changes

### Page Tracking
Every field now has a `page` attribute that tracks which page it belongs to:
```python
field.page = page_num  # 0-indexed (0 = page 1, 1 = page 2, etc.)
```

### Multi-Page Loop Pattern
All PDF processing now uses this pattern:
```python
for page_num in range(len(doc)):
    page = doc[page_num]
    # Process this page
    # Store page_num with each field
```

### Output Generation
When creating the filled PDF, the system now:
1. Loops through all pages in the original PDF
2. Copies each page to the output
3. Only adds filled content for fields that belong to that page

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Upload a multi-page PDF (2-3 pages)
2. Fill in fields on different pages
3. Download the filled PDF
4. Verify that **all pages** are present with correct filled data

## Benefits
✅ All pages from multi-page PDFs are now processed  
✅ Fields are correctly tracked with their page numbers  
✅ Downloaded PDFs contain all original pages  
✅ Filled content appears on the correct pages  
✅ No data loss from additional pages
