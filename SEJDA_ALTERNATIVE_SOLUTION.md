# Sejda Desktop Integration - Alternative Solutions

## Current Situation
Sejda PDF Desktop is installed but does NOT have a command-line interface (CLI). It's a GUI-only application.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Manual Workflow (Currently Implemented) ✅
**Status:** Ready to use NOW

**How it works:**
1. User manually opens Sejda Desktop
2. Uses "Forms → Detect Form Fields" to create fillable PDF
3. Saves the fillable PDF
4. Uploads the fillable PDF to our system using "Upload Fillable PDF (Sejda)" button
5. Our AI fills the fields automatically

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ 100% offline (no data leakage)  
- ✅ Best accuracy (Sejda's detection)
- ✅ AI-powered filling (our system)

**Steps for Users:**
See `SEJDA_DESKTOP_GUIDE.md` for complete instructions

### Option 2: Use PyMuPDF + Our Enhanced Detection (Fallback) ✅
**Status:** Already implemented as automatic fallback

**How it works:**
- If Sejda CLI not available, system uses our enhanced field detection
- Includes: AcroForm detection, dotted line detection, visual blank detection
- Creates fillable PDF automatically

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Fully automated
- ✅ No manual steps required
- ✅ 100% offline
- ✅ Good accuracy (not as good as Sejda, but functional)

### Option 3: Windows Automation (PyAutoGUI) - NOT RECOMMENDED
**Why NOT:** Unreliable, requires GUI interaction, can fail easily

---

### Option 4: Find Sejda Console Standalone
**Status:** To investigate

Check if Sejda offers a standalone console version separate from the Desktop app:
- https://sejda.com/
- Look for "Sejda Console" or "Sejda CLI" downloads

---

## Recommended Approach

### For Best Results (Current Implementation):

1. **Use the manual workflow** for critical documents:
   - Open Sejda Desktop
   - Detect form fields
   - Save fillable PDF
   - Upload to our system
   - AI fills automatically

2. **Use automatic fallback** for quick processing:
   - Just upload PDF normally
   - System uses enhanced detection
   - Still creates fillable PDF
   - AI fills automatically

---

## Current System Behavior

When you upload a PDF:

```
1. System checks if Sejda Desktop CLI is available
   ├─ YES → Uses Sejda CLI (best accuracy, offline)
   └─ NO  → Uses enhanced field detection (good accuracy, offline)

2. Creates fillable PDF automatically

3. AI fills all detected fields

4. Downloads filled PDF with editable fields
```

**ALL PROCESSING IS OFFLINE - NO DATA SENT ONLINE! ✅**

---

## Next Steps

1. **For immediate use:** Follow the manual workflow in `SEJDA_DESKTOP_GUIDE.md`

2. **For automated use:** Just upload PDFs normally - the fallback system works well

3. **For best of both worlds:** 
   - Use Sejda Desktop for first-time template creation
   - Save fillable template
   - Reuse template for similar documents
   - Our AI fills the fields each time
