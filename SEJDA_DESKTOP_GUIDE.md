## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Problem: Sejda didn't detect all fields

**Solution:**
- Use manual field addition in Sejda
- Ensure your PDF has clear dotted lines or blank spaces
- Try adjusting Sejda's detection sensitivity settings

### Problem: Upload failed

**Solution:**
- Make sure you're uploading the **fillable PDF** from Sejda, not the original
- Check file size (max 50MB)
- Ensure PDF is not password-protected

### Problem: AI didn't fill some fields

**Solution:**
- Check if the fields have clear context (labels nearby)
- Manually fill missing fields
- Use the chat feature to ask AI to fill specific fields

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Save Sejda Templates**: Once you create a fillable version for a document type (e.g., employment contract), save it as a template for reuse

2. **Field Naming**: In Sejda, you can name fields (e.g., "employee_name", "start_date") which helps AI understand what to fill

3. **Batch Processing**: Create fillable templates once, then use them multiple times with different AI data

4. **Quality Check**: Always review AI-filled data before final use
